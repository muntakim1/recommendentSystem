# recommendentSystem

This is a simple movie recomendent system build with python. Here I have used Cosin similarity between the vector points.

## Required Software

anaconda

## Packages 

``` pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn```

## Mathematical Equation

Here we can see &theta;<sub>0</sub> is closest &theta;<sub>1</sub>, and also &theta;<sub>1</sub> is closest &theta;<sub>2</sub>

  (&theta;<sub>0</sub>,&theta;<sub>1</sub>),(&theta;<sub>1</sub>,&theta;<sub>2</sub>),(&theta;<sub>2</sub>,&theta;<sub>3</sub>)
